# Haxe and System targets

Documentation about using the system targets from Haxe.

The current targets that I have tested is

- cpp (C++)
- cs (C#)
- interp (Eval/Macro)
- java
- lua
- jvm
- neko
- node.js (without installing npm packages)
- python

But Haxe has more system targets, that probably work exactly the same:

- hl (hashlink)
- php

## Haxe libs

And use `luarocks` to install dependency :

luarocks install bit32 # depends on the version you install
