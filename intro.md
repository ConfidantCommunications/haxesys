# Haxe and system targets

Documentation about using the system targets from Haxe.

![](img/haxe_logo.png)

The current targets that I have tested is

- cpp (C++)
- cs (C#)
- node.js (without installing npm packages)
- python
- java
- neko
- lua

But Haxe has more system targets, that probably work exactly the same:

- macro
- hl (hashlink)
- php

Practical information how to start are none existing, so I started to document my research.
I hope this will help. If you think so, why not help with [contribution](contribute.md) to this tutorial site.


## Node.js

As I mentioned above, I am not going to add node.js to all examples.
In some cases you need to install packages via npm.
This is not a difficult process, but not the intention of this tutorial.

## Lua

I have added Lua, but honestly: I have no idea what I am doing and why I have Lua installed.
Some example seem to work with my current install, but I am sure some examples don't work because I didn't follow the Lua install instructions.
So I am sorry in advance.




### How will this help me?

It will get you started with the Haxe system languages.
This probably will never be a complete documentation but it will help you get started!

### Who is this for?

For clever, cool and handsome developers. Duh! :D

## Documentation goals

I wanted to make contributing to this documentation as easy as possible.
That's why I use Markdown. Developers use it, but is just writing in plain English so **everybody** can write documentation!
And this documentation hosted on Github, developers favorite place to store code.
Even if you are not a developer. Don't want to clone everything, you still can change the files on the website (you need account to login in and change the `.md` files).
And as a final resort, you can leave your comments/suggestions/etc at the bottom of the page via Disqus.


## Open-sourcing the documentation

I thought I was the first to try to write documentation and open-sourcing it this way, but other beat me.
Although I was already writing everything with markdown, it looked like a good idea to use Gitbook to "publish" it. Writing documentation is like writing a book.

**Other clever developers who had this idea before me:**
