# About SQLite

In a previous example we used a simple flat-file 'database'.
An SQLite database is a database but the lite version. It's the local database for a lot of (mobile)apps.

## What is SQLite?

> SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. SQLite is the most widely deployed database engine in the world. The source code for SQLite is in the public domain.

Or (because it's the first place you look for information):

> SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a C programming library. In contrast to many other database management systems, SQLite is not a clientâ€“server database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program.
>
> SQLite is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standard, using a dynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee the domain integrity.[5]
>
> SQLite is a popular choice as embedded database software for local/client storage in application software such as web browsers. It is arguably the most widely deployed database engine, as it is used today by several widespread browsers, operating systems, and embedded systems, among others.[6] SQLite has bindings to many programming languages.
