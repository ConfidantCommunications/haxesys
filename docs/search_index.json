(hashlink)\nphp\n\nPractical information how to start are none existing, so I started to document my research.\nI hope this will help. If you think so, why not help with contribution to this tutorial site.\nNode.js\nAs I mentioned above, I am not going to add node.js to all examples.\nIn some cases you need to install packages via npm.\nThis is not a difficult process, but not the intention of this tutorial.\nLua\nI have added Lua, but honestly: I have no idea what I am doing and why I have Lua installed.\nSome example seem to work with my current install, but I am sure some examples don't work because I didn't follow the Lua install instructions.\nSo I am sorry in advance.\nHow will this help me?\nIt will get you started with C# (Unity) and Haxe.\nHow to setup your project, install externs and how to work with them. This probably will never be a complete documentation but it will help you get started!\nWho is this for?\nFor clever, cool and handsome developers. Duh! :D\nDocumentation goals\nI wanted to make contributing to this documentation as easy as possible.\nThat's why I use Markdown. Developers use it, but is just writing in plain English so everybody can write documentation!\nAnd this documentation hosted on Github, developers favorite place to store code.\nEven if you are not a developer. Don't want to clone everything, you still can change the files on the website (you need account to login in and change the .md files).\nAnd as a final resort, you can leave your comments/suggestions/etc at the bottom of the page via Disqus.\nOpen-sourcing the documentation\nI thought I was the first to try to write documentation and open-sourcing it this way, but other beat me.\nAlthough I was already writing everything with markdown, it looked like a good idea to use Gitbook to \"publish\" it. Writing documentation is like writing a book.\nOther clever developers who had this idea before me:\n\nbabylon js open sourcing the documentation\nbuilding markdown based developer docs\n\nOther resources about writing documentation (Markdown)\n\n13-things-people-hate-about-your-open-source-docs/\nhttps://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs\nhttps://github.com/karthik/markdown_science/wiki/Tools-to-support-your-markdown-authoring\nhttps://todaymade.com/blog/markdown-documentation-generator/\n\n"},"haxe/about.html":{"url":"haxe/about.html","title":"Haxe basics","keywords":"","body":"What is Haxe?\n\nLets get the Wikipedia description first:\n\nHaxe is an open source high-level multi-platform programming language and compiler that can produce applications and source code for many different platforms from a single code-base.\nHaxe includes a set of common functionality that is supported across all platforms, such as numeric data types, text, arrays, binary and some common file formats. Haxe also includes platform-specific API for Adobe Flash, C++, PHP and other languages.\nCode written in the Haxe language can be source-to-source compiled into ActionScript 3 code, JavaScript programs, Java, C# , C++ standalone applications, Python, PHP, Apache CGI, and Node.js server-side applications.\n\nFrom wikipedia\n\nAnd the official description:\n\nHaxe consists of a high-level, open source programming language and a compiler. It allows compilation of programs, written using an ECMAScript-oriented syntax, to multiple target languages. Employing proper abstraction, it is possible to maintain a single code-base which compiles to multiple targets.\nHaxe is strongly typed but the typing system can be subverted where required. Utilizing type information, the Haxe type system can detect errors at compile-time which would only be noticeable at run-time in the target language. Furthermore, type information can be used by the target generators to generate optimized and robust code.\n\nFrom haxe.org - manual\n\nHistory\nA long time ago, there was MTASC, the ActionScript 2 compiler which brought Flash to the entreprise,\nand its author, Nicolas Cannasse, decided to create a new open-source\nlanguage inspired by ActionScript and ML languages like Ocaml: Haxe.\nAround 2006, Haxe was born, designed to be adapted to a wide variety of targets, including Flash and JavaScript.\nEarly users\nIt was already the most modern compile-to-JS language, but of course a big focus from the author's company\nwas games, and likewise the initial community using Haxe was certainly oriented into gaming more than web apps.\nQuickly small companies and indie developers wanted to just code everything with Haxe: PHP on the server,\nJS for the web interactions, Flash for games, then C++ to look for more performance and freedom in games.\nNME and OpenFl appeared as the first big efforts to reproduce the Flash API for desktop and mobile - people\nhave started, abusively, assimilating OpenFl with Haxe, while it was just one library among many.\nThe raise of JavaScript\nJavaScript has taken the world by storm now; people use it for increasingly complex browser apps, but also\nfor command line and server applications, and even more recently for native apps using react-native.\nFollowing this trend, users of Haxe-JavaScript have also grown and keep up with the state of the art,\nand Haxe developers believe it's a better language for small to huge JavaScript projects.\nA popular language like TypeScript, which appeared much later than Haxe and recently gained a large\nfollowing thanks to being closer to ES6 and backed by big corporations, shows that typed languages\nare a concern which appeals to JavaScript developers. And while TypeScript is a decent language, it\nessentially has the same pros and cons as regular JavaScript and compilation is several orders of\nmagnitude slower than Haxe for large projects.\nThis documentation will hopefully demonstrate how easy it is to use Haxe for JavaScript development. It\nmay not look as easy as other compile-to-JS to get started but it really doesn't require a big investment\nto become familiar with it - and it will make you a better programmer.\n\n"},"haxe/quick-install.html":{"url":"haxe/quick-install.html","title":"Quick install","keywords":"","body":"Quick install\nThis tutorial is for the TL;DR crowd...\nYou just want to get started ... right!\n\nStep 0: You have joined an elite Haxe force!\nYou are cooler then a polar bear!\nStep 1: Install Haxe\nYou can find installers and binaries for Windows, OS X and Linux on http://haxe.org/download/.\n\nDownload\nAnd install\n\nStep 2: Install Editor\nYou need an editor, lets install Visual Studio Code\n\nOn the homepage of Visual Studio Code find the button for your OS.\n\nDownload\nAnd install\n\nStep 3: Install VSCode - Haxe Extension Pack\nTo get VSCode working with Haxe you should install the \"Haxe Extension Pack\"\n(Haxe Extension Pack )\n\nLaunch VS Code\nQuick Open (Ctrl+P / ⌘+P)\nPaste the following command: ext install haxe-extension-pack\nAnd type enter\n\nIt currently contains 3 extensions\n\nHaxe (Haxe Support for Visual Studio Code)\nHaxe Debug (Haxe Debug for flash target)\ncodedox (JSDoc style comments)\n\nBut that might become more in the future!\nStep 4 (extra): Install haxelib libraries\nThis is not necessary but something you eventually need to do.\n\nOpen terminal\nCopy and past the following\n\nhaxelib install hxnodejs\nhaxelib git js-kit https://github.com/clemos/haxe-js-kit.git haxelib\nhaxelib install markdown\nhaxelib install msignal\nStep 5 (Extra): Install NPM/Node.js\nDownload Node.js: get your version here: https://nodejs.org/\n\nDownload\nAnd install\n\nNow you have access to NPM.\n\nOpen terminal\nCopy and paste the following (and see current NPM version)\n\nnpm -v\n\n"},"haxe/installation.html":{"url":"haxe/installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Installing Haxe\n\nFirst, you will need to install Haxe (Neko and Haxelib).\nThere are a couple ways to install Haxe:\n\nGet the installer from haxe.org (original)\nUse NPM\nUse Homebrew\nUse Chocolatey\n\nAlthough all the installation methods should work.

JavaScript ecosystem for web app development is well implanted and NPM is at the centre of it. Coffeescript and Typescript are perfectly integrated and have offered a real alternative to full JavaScript development. For almost a year now, Haxe has constituted a third alternative in this ecosystem.\n\nHaxe, a language that compiles to JS\n\n\nNowadays there are a lot of languages that are able to compile to JS (e.g. Dart, TypeScript, Java/GWT etc.). One that is less well-known, but will surely blow your mind, is Haxe. It is one of the earliest languages that target JS (since 2006). It is a statically-typed language with ECMAScript like syntax.\n\nPeter Štefček (Pixel Federation): Open-source Lang. Haxe for Dev. of Platform-independent Apps\n\n\nIntroduction to open-source programming language Haxe, what it can offer and how you can use it to target multiple platforms.\nWill talk about what is Haxe and how it can help you to start develop multiplatform applications with ease. How you can leverage existing programming skills and even libraries from other languages like Javascript and can run across Flash, Javascript, C++, Android, iOS and many more.\nShowcase of Haxe's compiler to target native platforms as well as languages or VM's, and why it's a safe bet for a future-proof codebase.

Sometimes you have your own (util) library that you sometimes use.\nNormally all this code in included in your code, even when you don't use it. A good example is Jquery: mostly use for easy access to selectors but it also can do ajax call... If you don't use the ajax calls, this feature is embedded in \"your\" code.\nDead Code Elemination will remove code that you don't use.\n\n-debug Add debug information to the compiled code.\n\nThis information also generates the source-map which makes it easier to debug JavaScript code in the browser. It will map the js files code lines back to the original .hx files/classes. Very useful for debugging.\n\n--no-traces Don't compile trace calls in the program.\n\nIf you use the default loggin methode trace in Haxe, you have all the niceties from that logging system.\nBut useally you don't want that logging in the release/production version of your app. Use this to remove it!\n\n-resource [@name] Add a named resource file.\n\nUseful to embed resource files in your code. Think  config.json or welcome_massage.txt which you want to use immediatly\n\n-cmd Run the specified command after a successful compilation.\n\nMaybe you want a do something after Haxe compiler is ready. Something simple like -cmd echo 'done' or -cmd node main.js to run the node.js build directly after created.\nThe Haxe build file, build.hxml\nThere are a lot of different arguments that you are able to pass to the Haxe compiler.\nPlace these arguments into a text file of one per line with the extension hxml. This file can then passed directly to the Haxe compiler as a build script.\n# // build.hxml\n-cp src\n-main Main\n-js bin/example.js\n-dce full\nBuild js with Haxe\nTo finish and see what we have, build the file and see the result\n\nOpen your terminal\ncd to the correct folder where you have saved the build.hxml\nType haxe build.hxml\nPress enter\n\nIt will output\nExample\nYou could build everything directly in the terminal.\nhaxe -cp src -main Main -js bin/example.js -dce full\nIt will have the same result\n"},"resources/follow.html":{"url":"resources/follow.html","title":"Who to follow","keywords":"","body":"Who to follow\nThe Haxe community is a pleasant one.\nSo if you have questions, just go to the community.haxe and ask it.\nYou can also be non verbal and just follow Haxe people on Twitter for example.\nI have compiled a list of Haxe peeps with their speciality.\nGeneral / Java / Python / C++ / C# / JavaScript / PHP / Flash / Lua\n\nHaxe in general\nPeople how work on the Haxe compiler and thus are super smart!\nSpecially I want to point out Nicolas Cannasse, who is the creator of Haxe but not the only one who works on Haxe.\nYou see that this is a big international group of talented developers.\n\n\n\nName\nGithub\nTwitter\nBlog\n\n\n\n\nNicolas Cannasse\nncannasse\nncannasse\nhttp://ncannasse.fr/\n\n\nSimon Krajewski 1\nSimn\n\n\n\n\nCauê Waneck\nwaneck\ncwaneck\n\n\n\nHugh Sanderson\nhughsando\ngamehaxe\nhttp://gamehaxe.com/\n\n\nAndy Li\nandyli\nandy_li\nhttp://blog.onthewings.net/\n\n\nDan Korostelev\nnadako\nnadako\nhttps://nadako.github.io/rants/\n\n\nBruno Garcia\naduros\nb_garcia\nhttps://aduros.com/games/\n\n\nJason O'Neil\njasononeil\n\nhttp://jasono.co/\n\n\nfrabbit ?\nfrabbit\n\n\n\n\nJoshua Granick 5\njgranick\nsingmajesty\nhttp://www.joshuagranick.com/\n\n\nMark Knol 6\nmknol\nmarkknol\nhttp://blog.stroep.nl/\n\n\n\n\nJavaScript / Node.js\nHaxe developers are by nature inquisitive and mostly don't specialise in one language/target.
