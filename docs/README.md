# Haxe and the system targets

Documentation about using the system targets from Haxe.

The current targets that I have tested is

- cpp (C++)
- cs (C#)
- node.js (without installing npm packages)
- python
- java
- neko
- lua (I included lua, but I am sure I didn't install lua correctly)

But Haxe has more system targets, that probably work exactly the same:

- macro
- hl (hashlink)
- php
