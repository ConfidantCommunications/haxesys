# About static site generator

A very popylar option for websites are static site generators

> A static site generator (SSG) is a compromise between using a hand-coded static site and a full CMS. You generate an HTML-only website using raw data (such as Markdown files) and templates. The resulting build is transferred to your live server.

Here you can see the power of Haxe.

In this case it doesn't matter if you want a python or a node.js backend. You can make every backend that is a target in Haxe

We now have a very simple static site generator that use'


- node.js
- python
- neko
- cpp
- cs
- java


You can probably hava a Lua backend as wel, but I really need to install Lua properly.

I get this error
`module 'rex_pcre' not found`
