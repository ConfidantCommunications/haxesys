# About CLI

CLI = Command Line Interface

Old skool way to access your computer.
Usually via terminal.

Because you need to have access to the computer it will only work on the system targets

Just a short reminder:

- cpp (C++)
- cs (C#)
- node.js (without installing npm packages)
- python
- java
- neko
- lua


## Haxe for Command Line Interface (CLI) Apps

Haxe gives you a type-safe, fast and portable way to write CLI apps.

Use the language and libraries you are familiar with to write tasks for your servers or development environment.

The neko target provides a simple and powerful environment for running your Haxe CLI tools on any platform, and it integrates seamlessly with Haxelib. CLI apps can also be compiled to Java, PHP, C++ and more.
